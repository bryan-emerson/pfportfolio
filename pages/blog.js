        My Name Is Bryan Emerson! I&apos;m a Frontend Software Engineer with a
        penchant for clean code and user friendly solutions. I strive to create
        websites that meet client needs and expectations.

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>Current Role</Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        In my previous role I was one of two product lifecycle management
        developers for Laborie Medical Technologies; a global corporation
        spanning 110 countries and providing the best clinicians in the world
        with the technology needed to provide their patients critical care. In
        this role I was part of a cross functional team including two electrical
        engineers, two mechanical engineers, one design verification engineer,
        and one other software developer. My developer teammate and I were
        mainly responsible for integrating Laborie devices with hospital
        electronic medical record systems (some of our more common EMRs were
        Cerner and Epic). We would accomplish this by video conferencing with
        the client IT department, explaining how our software worked, noting
        their requirements, and then implementing the integration. We were also
        responsible for maintaining legacy device software and embedded
        firmware, as well as working with the other members of the cross
        functional team to integrate bluetooth devices and consumable RFID
        tags/scanners to Laborieâ€™s medical devices. In addition, I supported the
        sales team as a sales engineer, and assisted the design verification
        engineer when their workload was heavy.

        My technical foundation was built on eleven years of aircraft
        maintenance while working as a Crew Chief in the United States Air
        Force. My ability to effectively communicate comes from extensive
        experience in the hospitality sector, working positions ranging from
        bartender, to consultant, to owner/operator. These roles fortified my
        strong communication skills, enthusiasm for both customer and team
        relations, and attention to detail. These combined experiences in
        technical maintenance and customer relations forged an exemplary
        foundation for being an effective software engineer.

        When I'm not focused on work, you can find me outside hiking, biking,
        surfing, or collecting stamps in my passport! I am also passionate about
        photography and design!
